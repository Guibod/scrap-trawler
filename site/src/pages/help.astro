        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Hi, I’m Guillaume Boddaert — a French Magic: The Gathering player, judge, and tournament organizer. Like many of you, I’ve wrestled with EventLink, spreadsheets, and chaotic decklists.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I’m also a software engineer with over 25 years of experience. Scrap Trawler is my attempt to finally build something that’s not only powerful, but genuinely helpful to the community I care about.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          You might also stumble across <strong>Mightstone</strong> — a stalled Python project I started for MTG-related tools. Scrap Trawler is the spiritual reboot: lighter, faster, and already working.
        </p>

          🇫🇷 Always judge, sometimes code.
